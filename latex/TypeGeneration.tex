While the practical applications of the last example do not stretch very far\footnote{Considering that \AgdaDatatype{ℕ} is a candidate to be replaced by a more suitable unsigned integer type when compiling to Haskell anyway.}, we can generalize the idea to many other types and structures. In the same vein, we could define a simple but inefficient array type, and a more efficient implementation using trees. Then we can show that these are equivalent, such that when the simple type satisfies a set of laws, trees will satisfy them as well. %We could then start developing all sorts of complex implementations fine-tuned to each operation and figure out how these are equivalent to some simpler type, but let us first take a step back, and investigate how we can make this approach run smoothly in a simpler example.

But rather than inductively defining an array-like type and then showing that it is represented by a lookup function, we can go the other way around and define types by insisting that they are equivalent to such a function. This approach, in particular the case in which one calculates a container with the same shape as a numeral system, was dubbed numerical representations by Okasaki \cite{purelyfunctional}, and has some formalized examples in by Hinze and Swierstra \cite{calcdata} and Ko and Gibbons \cite{progorn}. Numerical representations are our starting point for defining more complex datastructures based on simpler ones, so let us demonstrate such a calculation. 

\subsection{From numbers to containers}\label{ssec:numrep}
We can compute the type of vectors starting from \bN{}.\footnote{This is adapted (and fairly abridged) from Calculating Datastructures \cite{calcdata}} For simplicity, we define them as a type computing function via the ``use-as-definition`` notation from before. We expect vectors to be represented by 
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{Lookup}
where we use the finite type \AgdaDatatype{Fin} as an index into vector. Using this representation as a specification, we can compute both \AgdaDatatype{Fin} and a type of vectors. The finite type can be computed from the evident definition
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{Fin-def}
using
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{leq-split}
Likewise, vectors can be computed by applying a sequence of type isomorphisms
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{Vec}
\investigate{SIP doesn't mesh very well with indexed stuff, does HSIP help?}

We can implement the following interface using \AgdaDatatype{Vec}
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{Array}
and show that this satisfies some usual laws like
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{Laws}
However, now that we defined \AgdaDatatype{Vec} from \AgdaDatatype{Lookup} we might as well use that.

The implementation of arrays as functions is very straightforward
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{FunArray}
and clearly satisfies our interface
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{FunLaw}
We can implement arrays based on \AgdaDatatype{Vec} as well\footnote{Note that, like any other type computing representation, we pay the price by not being able to pattern match directly on our type.}
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRep]{VecArray}
but now the equality allows us to transport proofs from \AgdaDatatype{Lookup} to \AgdaDatatype{Vec}.\footnote{Except that due to the simplicity of this case, the laws are trivial for \AgdaDatatype{Vec} as well.}
\investigate{As you can see, taking ``use-as-definition'' too literally prevents Agda from solving a lot of metavariables.}

\investigate{This computation can of course be generalized to any arity zeroless numeral system; unfortunately beyond this set of base types, this ``straightforward'' computation from numeral system to container loses its efficacy. In a sense, the n-ary natural numbers are exactly the base types for which the required steps are convenient type equivalences like $(A + B) \to C = (A \to C) \times (B \to C)$?}

%\subsection{Relating types by structure: Ornamentation (unfinished)}\label{sec:ornament}
\subsection{Numerical representations as ornaments}\label{ssec:ornaments}
We could perform the same computation for \bL{}, which would yield the type of binary trees, but we note that these computations proceed with roughly the same pattern: each constructor of the numeral system gets assigned a value, and is amended with a field holding a number of elements and subnodes using this value as a ``weight''. This kind of ``modifying constructors'' is formalized by ornamentation \cite{progorn}, which lets us formulate what it means for two types to have a ``similar'' recursive structure. This is achieved by interpreting (indexed inductive) datatypes from descriptions, between which an ornament is seen as a certificate of similarity, describing which fields or indices need to be introduced or dropped to go from one description to the other. Furthermore, one-sided ornaments (ornamental descriptions) lets us describe new datatypes by recording the modifications to an existing description.
\todo[inline]{Put some minimal definitions here.}

This links back to the construction in the previous section, since \bN{} and \AgdaDatatype{Vec} share the same recursive structure, so \AgdaDatatype{Vec} can be formed by introducing indices and adding a field holding an element at each node.%\footnote{These and similar examples are also documented in \cite{progorn}} 

However, instead deriving \AgdaDatatype{List} from \bN{} generalizes to \bL{} with less notational overhead, so lets tackle that case first. For this, we have to give a description of \bN{} to work with
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRepOrn]{NatD}
Recall that \AgdaInductiveConstructor{σ} adds a field, upon which the rest of the description may vary, and \AgdaInductiveConstructor{ṿ} lists the recursive fields and their indices (which can only be \AgdaInductiveConstructor{tt}).
We can now write down the ornament which adds fields to the \AgdaFunction{suc} constructor
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRepOrn]{ListO}
Here, the \AgdaInductiveConstructor{σ} and \AgdaInductiveConstructor{ṿ} are forced to match those of \AgdaDatatype{NatD},
but the \AgdaInductiveConstructor{Δ} adds a new field. With the least fixpoint and description extraction, this is sufficient to define \AgdaDatatype{List}. Note that we cannot hope to give an unindexed ornament from \bL{}
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRepOrn]{LeibnizD}
into trees, since trees have a very different recursive structure! Instead, we must keep track at what level we are in the tree so that we can ask for adequately many elements:
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/NumRepOrn]{TreeO}
We use the \AgdaFunction{power} combinator to ensure that the digit at position $n$, which has weight $2^n$ in the interpretation of a binary number, also holds its value times $2^n$ elements. This makes sure that the number of elements in the tree shaped after a given binary number also is the value of that  binary number.

This ``folding in'' technique using the indices to keep track of structure seems to apply more generally. Let us explore this a bit further, and return later to the generalization of the pattern from numeral systems to datastructures.
% i.e. why did this even work?

\subsection{Heterogeneization}
The situation in which one wants to collect a variety of types is not uncommon, and is typically handled by tuples. However, if e.g., you are making a game in Haskell, you might feel the need to maintain a list of ``Drawables'', which may be of different types. Such a list would have to be a kind of ``heterogeneous list''. In Haskell, this can be resolved by using an existentially quantified list, which, informally speaking, can contain any type implementing some constraint, but can only be inspected as if it contains the intersection of all types implementing this constraint. 

This of course ports fairly directly to Agda, but is cumbersome when we just want to make a pile of different types, and becomes impractical if we want to be able to inspect the elements. The alternative is to split our heterogeneous list into two parts; one tracking the types, and one tracking the values. In practice, this means that we implement a heterogeneous list as a list of values indexed over a list of types. This approach and mainly its specialization to binary trees is investigated by Swierstra \cite{hetbin}.

We will demonstrate that we can express this ``lift a type over itself'' operation as an ornament. For this, we make a small adjustment to \AgdaDatatype{RDesc} to track a type parameter separately from the fields. Using this we define an ornament-computing function, which given a description computes an ornamental description on top of it:
\todo{Oops}
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Heterogenize]{HetO}
This ornament relates the original unindexed type to a type indexed over it; we see that this ornament largely keeps all fields and structure indentical, only performing the necessary bookkeeping in the index, and adding extra fields before parameters.

As an example, we adapt the list description
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Heterogenize]{List}
which is easily heterogeneized to an \AgdaDatatype{HList}. In fact, \AgdaFunction{HetO} seems to act functorially; if we lift \AgdaDatatype{Maybe} like
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Heterogenize]{HMaybe}
then we can lift functions like \AgdaFunction{head} as
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Heterogenize]{hhead}


\begin{comment}
\subsection{Folding in}\label{ssec:flattening}
Let us describe this procedure of folding a complex recursive structure into a simpler structure more generally. In particular, we will demonstrate that for linear datatypes, such as \bN{} and \bL{}, and for a given unindexed datatype, there is always an indexed datatype isomorphic to it at some index, and an ornament from the linear type to the indexed type. 

Suppose we are given a description, the first thing we can do to simplify it is collect all fields in one place
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{RField}
Next, we will certainly have to count the number of recursive occurrences we are tracking, so we define
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{Number}
where \AgdaInductiveConstructor{𝟙} records that we are at the top level, and \AgdaInductiveConstructor{ṿ} denotes that we are below a constructor with some number of recursive fields. This simplifies our task to implementing the types in
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{nested}
such a way that we get an isomorphism 
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{wish}
Thus, \AgdaDatatype{Fields} is forced to have a \AgdaInductiveConstructor{leaf} constructor like 
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{Fields}
if \AgdaFunction{nested} is to work at \AgdaInductiveConstructor{𝟙}. The \AgdaInductiveConstructor{node} constructor makes sure that if we have collection of \AgdaDatatype{Fields}, then we can gather them in a field at a higher level. We can then count the subnodes of a given \AgdaDatatype{Fields} as
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{subnodes}
where \AgdaFunction{RSize} counts the number of recursive fields of a particular branch
\ExecuteMetaData[Tex/Flatten]{RSize}
Note that \AgdaFunction{subnodes} effectively keeps the shape of the previous field, but unfolds the recursive fields at the bottom of the tree by one level.

\investigate{I then tried and realized how unpleasant even the functions from the original type to the nested type are to write.}

As a trivialty, we get that any type, interpreted as a container, always decomposes as an ornament over a ``numerical'' base type.\todo[inline]{Or at least, that was where I was trying to go with this, but I notice that this still is a bit further away.} This links to the construction of binary heaps in \cite{progorn}, as in hindsight, starting from the usual binary heaps would yield binary numbers and their binary heap ornament (in a much less useful package).
